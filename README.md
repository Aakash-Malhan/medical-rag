# Misdiagnosis Risk Reduction via Medical RAG – COVID-19

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that surfaces relevant COVID-19 research and generates grounded, source-linked summaries using **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.  
Deployed as a Gradio app on Hugging Face Spaces and backed by a FAISS vector store built on a curated subset of the **CORD-19** corpus.
